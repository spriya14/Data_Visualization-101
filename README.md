# Data_Visualization-101
Visualization of data using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plots to a huge dataset.

**Overview Of Data**:
The human activities dataset contains 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects. The dataset is downloaded from the link mentioned below.
The code downloads the data, cleans it , creates feature vector and then uses T-SNE to reduce dimensionality of the feature vector to just 2, and matplotlib was then used to visualize the data.



Required Libraries :
        numpy
        pandas
        sklearn
        matplotlib
